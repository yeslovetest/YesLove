Virtual Events is an add-on to The Events Calendar suite of products that optimizes your calendar, tickets, and email notifications for virtual events.

== Description ==

Virtual Events comes loaded with features and integrations to optimize your calendar for online gatherings, webinars, classes, and performances. Whether you want to easily showcase virtual events, embed livestreams, integrate with tools like Zoom, or assure that your virtual events show up properly in Google results, Virtual Events has you covered.

See the <a href="https://evnt.is/ve-started">Virtual Events Getting Started Guide</a> to jump in now.

Virtual Events is an add-on for The Events Calendar and is compatible with Events Calendar Pro. Plus, when combined with Event Tickets (or Event Tickets Plus), it does even more for ticketed virtual events.

= Features =

For The Events Calendar (and Pro), Virtual Events will:
✔️ Offer a customizable "Livestream" tag in your calendar views
✔️ Generate a Zoom link (requires authorizing your Zoom connection)
✔️ Embed video on the event page
✔️ Add a linked button where attendees can join the event
✔️ Choose whether to show live event information immediately or 15 minutes before your event starts
✔️ Flexibility for events happening online and in-person

When running Event Tickets (and Plus) alongside The Events Calendar, Virtual Events will:
✔️ Give the option of hiding the virtual event link (to Zoom, webinar or elsewhere) until the attendees submits and RSVP or buys a ticket
✔️ Will give the option to only email the virtual event link after RSVP or ticket purchase

For a full list of The Events Calendar features, check out that plugin's readme.txt or check out <a href="https://evnt.is/1akd">the product page</a>.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions and wait as the upload completes.
5. When it's finished, activate the plugin via the prompt. A message will show confirming activation was successful. A link to access the calendar directly on the frontend will be presented here as well.
6. For access to new updates, make sure you have added your valid License Key under Events --> Settings --> Licenses. You can find your license key on your tri.be account at https://evnt.is/1akc.
