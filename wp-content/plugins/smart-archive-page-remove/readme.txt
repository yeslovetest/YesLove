Completely remove unwanted Archive Pages from your Blog

== Description ==

The Smart Archive Page Remove Plugin allows you to remove Archive Pages automatically generated by WordPress

== Retired Plugin ==

Development, maintenance and support of this plugin has been retired in october 2023. You can use this plugin as long as is works for you. 

There will be no more updates and I won't answer any support questions. Thanks for your understanding.

Feel free to fork this plugin.

== Usage ==

WordPress automatically generates Author based, Category based, Tag based and Date based (daily, monthly and yearly) archives for your posts. Even if you do not want to use these Pages - e.g. you don't want to have an author based archive page on a single author blog or you don't want to have a daily archive because you don't post several times a day - they exist and they can be accessed by their automated generated URL.

The smart Archive Page Remove Plugin adds an item 'Archive Pages' in the 'Settings' section of your WordPress Admin. Here you can select which Archive Pages you want to **remove**. Removed Archive Pages are no longer accessible and cause a 404 page not found error. They can be restored anytime.

Requesting a removed archive page results in a 404 file not found error which lets a Search Engine know that the page does not exist and has to be removed from the search index.
