== Changelog ==

= v2.0.12 - 10/26/2023 =

- Fix: Prevent extra 301 redirect due to missing trailing slash on some URLs.
- Fix: Issue with Custom Message replacement not always working on pages built with Elementor.

= v2.0.11 - 10/04/2023 =

- Improvement: Query Monitor integration to show which restrictions are active on a page.
  - Shows global settings that may be affecting the page.
  - Shows which restrictions are active on the page.
  - Shows which posts are being filtered out of queries and by which restriction.
- Tweak: Ensure upgrade stream doesn't send headers if they were already sent.
- Tweak: Make second arg on get_the_excerpt filter optional to prevent errors with some plugins.
- Fix: Bug when using `content_control/check_all_restrictions` filter that caused rules to not compare properly.

= v2.0.10 - 10/01/2023 =

- Improvement: If no v1 global restrictions existed, skip the migration step entirely.
- Improvement: Default to late init of post query filtering until after plugins_loaded should be finished. This should prevent help prevent random errors due to restrictions being checked before plugins have had a chance to register their post types, and thus restrictions won't properly match those post type rules.
- Improvement: Add check to prevent restriction checks for **WP CLI** requests.
- Improvement: Add notice to indicate is when waiting for post/page search results in the restriction editor fields.
- Tweak: Fix issue in build that caused autoloader to not fully use optimized classmap, should result in improved performance.
- Fix: Ensure `$wp_rewrite` is available before calling `is_rest()` -> `get_rest_url()`. This should prevent errors when using the plugin with **WP CLI** and when plugins make `WP_Query` calls during `plugins_loaded`.
- Fix: Don't attempt to initialize side query filtering until after_theme_setup hook. This should prevent errors when plugins make `WP_Query` calls during `plugins_loaded`, and allow further delaying initialization if needed from themes `functions.php` file.
- Fix: Backward compatibility issue with WP versions <6.2 that made settings page not render.
- Fix: Bug where Block Controls didn't work on WooCommerce pages. This was filtering `pre_render_block` but not returning a value. Now we run our check after theirs to ensure that bug has no effect on our plugin. [Report](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/issues/11077)

- Improvement: Better handling of restriction titles & content. Admins with priv can insert any content into the restriction messages.
- Improvement: Added new filter `content_control/query_filter_init_hook` to allow delaying query filtering for compatibility with plugins that make custom queries before `template_redirect` action.

```
add_filter( 'content_control/query_filter_init_hook', function () {
    return 'init'; // Try setup_theme, after_theme_setup, init or wp_loaded
} );
```
