This plugin supports content restrictions on posts,pages,custom post types, navigation menus,widgets and post attachments.Also the plugin allows you to hide specific content within posts and pages using a shortcode.

Apart from that you will get a unique private portal page for every user of your site and let the administrator add user specific content to this client area.
