CONTENT RESTRICTION / PAGE POST RESTRICTION | PROTECT CONTENT FOR WORDPRESS

Content Restriction provide control of the entire content of your WordPress sites. This includes Page Restriction and Post Restriction i.e. Content restriction according to User Roles. You can Protect content by setting consent for single-entity users on WordPress sites based on their roles. Here a user role has permission to access a page; the authorization enables access to that user. By default, all roles will have access to the content of the page. 
Page Restriction provides page protection by allowing content access to only Logged In Users to specific or all pages. Restrict access of your pages to logged-out users by showing them an error message letting them know they do not have permission to look into the content on the particular page.

Besides Page Restrictions, we also provide Post Restrictions (Content restriction) feature which helps to Protect content by Restricting access for posts on logged-in/out status to users or specific user roles. Our WordPress Post restrictions feature also helps you to Restrict access in categories to logged-in/out users or specific user roles. We Display a custom message to users who do not have permission to view the content or redirect them to a specified URL. In our Page restriction, Post restriction Plugin our Individual Posts feature will enable protection for default posts as well as custom post types.

Content Restriction also includes role-based capabilities which help in creating new custom roles and provide capabilities. You can create roles and customize them by assigning various WordPress capabilities to them according to requirements. You can also restrict content of your WordPress according to these custom roles with the help of our roles and capabilities feature.
